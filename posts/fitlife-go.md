FitLife Go is a comprehensive system for managing personal information of clients, with the capability of recording check-ins using QR code technology. It provides a seamless solution for efficiently managing client information within fitness facilities. The system was developed and implemented using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a component-based approach for developing dynamic web applications.

- **TypeScript**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by providing static type checking, improved code maintainability, and increased productivity.

- **Firebase**: A powerful platform provided by Google that offers a suite of services to build and manage web and mobile applications. Firebase provides features such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting.

- **Firestore**: A flexible and scalable NoSQL cloud database offered by Firebase. It allows for real-time data synchronization and offers powerful querying capabilities for efficient data retrieval.

- **QR Code Technology**: FitLife Go leverages QR code technology for check-in functionality. Clients can scan QR codes displayed at fitness facility entrances to record their check-ins conveniently.

With FitLife Go, managing personal information of clients becomes effortless. The system enables fitness facilities to securely store and retrieve client data, providing a seamless check-in process through QR code scanning.

By incorporating React, TypeScript, Firebase, Firestore, and QR code technology, FitLife Go ensures a robust and user-friendly experience for both fitness facility administrators and clients.
