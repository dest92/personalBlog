FitLife Manager is a comprehensive system for controlling clients, machines, suppliers, statistics, and other relevant aspects. It provides an integrated solution to manage various components of a fitness facility efficiently. The system was developed and deployed using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which offers a component-based approach for developing dynamic web applications.

- **TypeScript**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by providing static type checking, improved code maintainability, and increased productivity.

- **Firebase**: A powerful platform provided by Google that offers a suite of services to build and manage web and mobile applications. Firebase provides features such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting.

- **Firestore**: A flexible and scalable NoSQL cloud database offered by Firebase. It allows for real-time data synchronization and offers powerful querying capabilities for efficient data retrieval.

- **Supabase**: An open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a set of services to develop modern applications. Supabase includes features like authentication, real-time database, and serverless functions.

- **MUI (Material-UI)**: A popular React UI framework that follows the principles of Material Design. It offers a set of customizable and reusable UI components that help in building aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interfaces.

With FitLife Manager, you can streamline your fitness facility's operations by efficiently managing clients, machines, suppliers, statistics, and other essential aspects. The system's integration of React, TypeScript, Firebase, Firestore, Supabase, and MUI ensures a robust and seamless user experience.
